# Transport-Web-Service-Hackathon-
The UK Government provides a DataSet named NaPTAN (National Public Transport Access Nodes) which contains all of the locations at which you can get on or off public transport in the UK. The dataset includes details of bus stops, railway stations, urban/suburban light railway stations (e.g. Manchester’s Metrolink and the London Underground), airports and ferry terminals. This is the dataset that mapping apps use to pinpoint the location of public transport. The dataset is made available in either XML or CSV-based formats by the government. I was given an SQLite database with a trimmed down selection of columns, and a number of nearduplicate records removed for you to use in this hackathon task. My task was to create a web service using the Spark Java microservice framework, the SQLite JDBC driver, the reference JSON parser, and Java’s built-in DOM XML parser. 

This was done in the Eclipse Java IDE.
